## Features

- Input names of tokens in a pool.
- Input current quantity of tokens and their price ratio.
- Input the current value of the pool and amounts of tokens to add.
- Calculate new quantities, prices, and values of tokens after adding the specified amounts.
- Display the results in a separate window.
